Thermodynamic models
======
In pharmecetitical and many other industies, how to predict the propertiet is crucial for the production process.


Simulation of active matters
======
Active matter is matter composed of large numbers of active "agents", each of which consumes energy in order to move or to exert mechanical forces, e.g. cells grow and divide into a larger colony. Due to the feature 

Theoretical biophysics
======
Physics can help to understand biology, as it mainly provides the understanding under the hood. For -->
