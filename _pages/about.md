- I am a Data Scientist interested in realizing the new machine-learning techniques for real-world problems. I came from an engineering background, with research focusing on using computer simulations and numerical modelings to optimize or understand complicated processes. 
<!-- - I work for [CTW Inc](https://ctw.inc) as a Data Scientist. - I use to be a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.ch.t.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en?set_language=en) at [Kyoto Univerisity](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/). I was under the supervision of [Prof. Ryoichi Yamamoto](http://www-tph.cheme.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.pukiwiki.php?ry%2FFrontPage) ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZVwSewgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Lab page](http://www-tph.cheme.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/)), with an enjoyable and fruitful collobaration with [Prof. Matthew Turner](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=HjxetPMAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) and [Prof. Simon Schnyder](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=XkerYaAAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1). My past research interests (when I was in acdemia) including numerical modeling of biological systems, mainly at level of cell-base tissue, specifically for comepetition/coexsitence of biological tissue, mechanical modeling of tumor growth and interface dynamics of 3D colony growth. -->

- I recived my Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from [*Kyoto University*](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ja), M.Sc. degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from [*Hong Kong University of Science and Technology*](https://www.ust.hk), and my B.Eng. degree in Chemical Engineering and Technolohy from [*Southwest Petroleum Univeristy*](https://www.swpu.edu.cn/en/).

- Born and raised in Sichuan, China.
