More about me
======
TLDR: A Data Scientist has an academic background in simulation/modeling and a deep interest in providing state-of-art Machine Learning solutions at industry.

I'm Jintao, and I work as a Data Scientist at Ocean Network Express.I hail from Sichuan, China, a place I'm immensely proud of, not only for being the home of the majestic giant pandas but also for its globally renowned Sichuan cuisine.

My academic journey began in the field of Chemical Engineering, focusing on optimization, process design, and process control in industrial petrochemical plants. This was during my undergraduate studies in my home province. I had the opportunity to engage in several mini-projects where I explored simulation tools like Aspen Plus, which sparked my interest in numerical modeling.

Motivated by this fascination, I pursued a master's degree. The advanced curriculum covered a wide range of contemporary topics in Chemical Engineering. During this time, I undertook a research project that involved simulating thermodynamics in a continuous crystallization process for pharmaceutical production. This project, where I extensively used MATLAB, deepened my understanding of programming.

After completing my master's degree at HKUST, my interest shifted more towards natural science and theoretical models, leading me to join Kyoto University. My time in Kyoto was memorable, working alongside many mentors who gently guided me into the world of programming and physics. My research there not only enriched my knowledge in biophysics but also involved developing and maintaining repositories and data pipelines.

Thanks to the experiences I gained during my education, I developed the skills necessary to embark on a career as a Data Scientist. While the definition of Data Science can be somewhat ambiguous nowadays, I see it as a field dedicated to helping people comprehend current situations and identify improvement opportunities by leveraging the power of big data. This aligns perfectly with my role at ONE, where I provide scientifically grounded insights from our extensive databases and offer cutting-edge solutions, both cloud data pipeline management and state-of-art ML model building. These efforts assist stakeholders in making informed decisions.
